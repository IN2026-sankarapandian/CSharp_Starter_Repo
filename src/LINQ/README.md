# LINQ in C#
 
## Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of LINQ in C#.
It includes how LINQ can be used to work with arrays, lists, and other collections to perform operations like filtering, sorting and grouping.
 
## Tasks Breakdown
 
### Task 1: Basic LINQ Queries
- Filter Electronics with price > 500
- Sort them by descending price
- Calculate their average price
 
### Task 2: Complex LINQ Queries
- Group all products by category
- Join products with their suppliers using productId
 
### Task 3: LINQ to Object
- Find second largest number in array
- Print pairs of numbers that add to a target
 
### Task 4: Performance consideration with LINQ
- Filter books and order by ascending price using LINQ
- I have optimised it with using Sort.
 
### Task 5: Query Builder
- I have created a query builder with filter, sort, and join operation.
- Created a querybuilder class having single generic type to handle filter and join.
- Created a another child querybuilder class with three generic types to handle join.
- Used method hiding, inheritance, fluent API to construct this query builder.
